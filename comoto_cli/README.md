# COMOTO CLI

We recommend setting up an alias `alias m=comoto_cli`

TODO: can `cd` be accomplished in an executable? ... using exec that is...
TODO: add to a setup script "recommended: install modheader for chrome"
TODO: part of setup should also be the recommendation to open that elasticsearch browser window. FOr me, I reached about 4.5 million records in 8 or 9 hours.
  That's half a mil each hour
TODO: make a note that bouncing the containers during the elasticsearch step will kill that step. Beware
TODO: add something about the elixir formatter?
