# git & github

## setup

- install gh cli
- use gh repo clone jonathanchukinas/config and it'll walk you through creating the ssh key. Don't use a password. That'll screw up the comoto stuff. Annoying.
create token
- add token to gh
- add instructions to top-level readme on how to first clone my dotfiles repo (using https?) and
  then setting it to track on ssh after setting up token

## TODO
- create alias that'll create new branch and create an upstream
