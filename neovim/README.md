# Neovim Config

## Install

neovim gets installed via asdf

## TODO

Add setup that fetches my nvim config from github
gh has to already be set up
my gh token has to already be set up
Then I need to symlink ~/.config/nvim/ to that repo

add a bashrc that contains nvim-specific stuff

Can I run :healthcheck from bash?

add my neovim config as submodile?
