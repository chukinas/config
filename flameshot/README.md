# SCREENSHOTS W/ FLAMESHOT

## SETUP
1. `sudo apt install flameshot`
2. Remove default `print` button keybinding
3. Add custom keybinding: `print` -> `flameshot gui`
4. Set color to that bright green

TODO ... I'm not sure steps 2 & 3 above are needed anymore.
Maybe it's nice to leave them assigned to the befault screen capture,
which is much better than it used to be.

## USAGE
- Press `print` key to start snapshot
- Click and drag
- Right-click in image to pick color
- Scroll mouse wheel to change stroke width
- <C-s> to save
